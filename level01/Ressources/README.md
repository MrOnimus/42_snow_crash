After some wandering through the system, we came across the file /etc/passwd. And we've noticed something strange: the password for the flag01 account was not in the /etc/shadow file, but it still was encrypted. So, what can we do with encrypted file? Of course, we can use rainbow tables, but their size is usually about several hundreds thousands of gigabytes. We're simply doesn't have that much space. Because of that we've copied the /etc/passwd file to the local machine with the command `scp -P 2222 level00@127.0.0.1:/etc/passwd .`, after that we've sent it to the other machine with the command `passwd someaddress@direct.labs.play-with-docker.com:/root`, where we've hacked it using John the Reaper with the corresponding command `john passwd`. That's how we've got the next password: "abcdefg". We've logged into the flag01 user and executed the command `getflag`, to get the next flag: "f2av5il02puano7naaf6adaaf".
