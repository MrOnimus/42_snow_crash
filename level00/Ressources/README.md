First of all, we enter the environment with the pair of login:password level00:level00. We searched for files belonging to the user flag00 using command `find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null`, and found two files, both of which contained the same string "cdiiddwpgswtgt". As the resulting string did not contain numbers, we thought that perhaps we were looking at a string encrypted with Caesar's cipher. Using an online (utility)[https://md5decrypt.net/en/Caesar/#results] to encrypt and decrypt the Caesar cipher, we discovered, using the bruteforce method, that the string we received was converted to the string "nottoohardhere", which, obviously, was the password to the flag00 account.
After logging to the flag00 account we've got the 0 flag using the command `getflag`: x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias.
